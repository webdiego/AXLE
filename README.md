## My process

I started the process of creating the layout using AdobeXD.
I researched the design on Dribble for have some inspiration.

After completing the design phase,I've created a profile in mailchimp and used the package "Mailchimp-Subscribe" for create the subscribe component.
I've also used another great tool for render the video, "React-Player".
